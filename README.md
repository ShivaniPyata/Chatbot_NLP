# Chatbot_NLP
Introduction:
A chatbot is a program or a software that can simulate a human conversation (text or speech) with a user in natural language through websites, messengers, applications or through mobile devices. The uses for chatbots are countless, e-commerce customer service, video games, placing online orders, or even becoming a personal assistant are some of the areas where chatbots thrive.

Communication with such a bot is possible through pre-set rules. User input must conform to these predefined rules in order to get an answer. Since, no artificial intelligence is used, an open conversation with this type of bot is not possible or very limited. Understanding language is especially useful when it comes to chatbots. Unlike the rule based bots, AI bots use algorithms (Neural Networks) to process natural language. This is where the term Natural Language Processing comes from. The chatbot not only recognizes specific words, but it also understands what someone is saying.

In any case, the usage of AI in an industry where an individual’s life could be at stake might not be convincing. It brings us to the question of whether such tasks ought to be assigned to human staff. This healthcare chatbot system is built using deep learning techniques which contain intents, patterns and responses along with a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify the category of user’s message. It will help users by providing healthcare assistance 24/7, answering questions in general, helping us locate a nearby hospital in case of emergencies. By a series of queries, it helps the users by guiding them to find what they are looking for.
